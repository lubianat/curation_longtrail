# The situation

1.  Research projects always involve familiarization with the literature. This is true for all projects, but it's more explicit and obviously true for narrative and systematic reviews.

2.  Often (if not always) the literature curation generates intermediate products containing organized, tabulated information about the articles of interest. These intermediate tables are the basis for preparing experiments and discussing results. For instance, in systematic reviews, they are screened based on certain criteria, and only a fraction of the studies are included in the end.

3.  While when pooled together, this might amount to an enormous amount of data, most scientists produce small datasets [@ferguson2014] - most of which, currently, are not made public.

# The opportunity

1.  These intermediate tables are a rich source of organized information about research projects. They are the distilled product of several days of highly-specialized work.

2.  They are already organized (you needed to organize it for your project!) and could be made available to the community.

3.  Large biocuration databases, like UniProt [*add other examples*], are a core resource of current research.

4.  The large amount of small hidden data curations, if combined and distributed, could make a similarly huge impact in the flow of information.

# The approach

- Make datasets available in Zenodo

- Describe datasets with enough information to facilitate reuse

- Use, when possible, identifiers.

- If feeling confortable, add to Wikidata and reference your publically available table.

# The why

- Your work has value: other researchers will love to see your curation, even if it is not perfect. If could save them many hours of work. 

- A table in Zenodo with a DOI is citable, more recognition for you. 

- Google Datasets makes it very easy to find the work: others will find, and you will find.

- Making it public improves the curation quality, thereby in a cascade improving the quality of your work. 

- In 5 years, you can find your curation on Google, instead of spending hours sifting through old e-mails, Google Drive, Dropbox or even hard drives. 
You are your most likely future colaborator. 

- Connecting to Wikidata enables powerful queries via the SPARQL query system. 

- Connecting to Wikidata enables use of the Scholia platform to visualize the topics you have curated.

- Connecting to Wikidata makes it visible for everyone to improve Academic Search Engines, a systemic change that stands to benefit everyone.
