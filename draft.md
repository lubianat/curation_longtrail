# The situation

- Research projects always involve familiarization with the literature. 
- True for all projects, but obviously true for narrative and systematic reviews. 

- Often (if not always) the literature curation generates intermediate products
contained organized, tabulated information about the articles of interest

- These intermediate tables are the basis for preparing experiments and discussing results. 

- In reviews, they are screened based on certain criteria, and only a fraction of the studies
 are included in the end.

# The opportunity

- The intermediate tables are a rich source of organized information about research projects.
They are the distilled product of several days of highly-specialized work. 

- They are already organized (you needed to organize it for your project!) and could be made available to the community. 

- Large biocuration  databases, like UniProt, are a core resource of current research 

- The large amount of small hidden curations, if combined and distributed, could make a similarly huge impact in the flow of information. 

# The approach

- Make datasets available in Zenodo

- Describe datasets with enough information to facilitate reuse

- Use, when possible, identifiers.

- If feeling confortable, add to Wikidata and reference your publically available table.

# The why

- Your work has value: other researchers will love to see your curation, even if it is not perfect. If could save them many hours of work. 

- A table in Zenodo with a DOI is citable, more recognition for you. 

- Google Datasets makes it very easy to find the work: others will find, and you will find.

- Making it public improves the curation quality, thereby in a cascade improving the quality of your work. 

- In 5 years, you can find your curation on Google, instead of spending hours sifting through old e-mails, Google Drive, Dropbox or even hard drives. 
You are your most likely future colaborator. 

- Connecting to Wikidata enables powerful queries via the SPARQL query system. 

- Connecting to Wikidata enables use of the Scholia platform to visualize the topics you have curated.

- Connecting to Wikidata makes it visible for everyone to improve Academic Search Engines, a systemic change that stands to benefit everyone.
